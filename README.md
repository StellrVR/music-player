### July's Music Player

Here's my music player with the basic knowledge of JavaScript that I know.
Keep in mind that I am not the best with JS, so it may not be the best, but it works.
You can change how it looks to whatever you'd like, just **make sure to look at the comments in the code**

I tried my best to comment on what each thing does, but if there's any problems, just let me know what it is via Discord, submit an issue, or send me an email (me@july.lol).

**I only ask to give credit if you use it**

Here's how it looks on my site:
